<h3 id="org0816636">Disclaimer</h3>
<p>
Analysis was done from the Penguin edition of <i>Aeneid Book 4</i>, with Latin quotes correlated based on the Loeb edition. There may be minor discrepancies between the English and Latin quotes that I&rsquo;ve overlooked!
</p>

<p>
Please let me know of any of these issues, and I&rsquo;ll happily update this presentation!

<h2 id="org7989021">What does Dido do?</h2>
<ul style="text-align:left">
<li>&ldquo;saevit inops animi totamque incensa per urbem bacchatur, qualis commotis excita sacris Thyias, ubi audito stimulant trieterica Baccho orgia nocturnusque vocat clamore Cithaeron&rdquo; (300-303)</li>
<li>&ldquo;tandem his Aenean compellat vocibus ultro&rdquo; (304)</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;She raged and raved round the whole city like a Bacchant stirred &#x2026; and roused to frenzy&rdquo; &#x2013; her actions directly convey this sense of subservience to her emotions, she is characterised as completely frenzied and overcome by madness here</li>
<li>&ldquo;Before he could speak, she cried&rdquo; &#x2013; sense of impatient madness juxtaposed to Aeneas&rsquo; piety, making him look much better against the backdrop of her seeming insanity</li>

</ul>

</aside>

</section>
<section>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Talia dicentem iamdudum aversa tuetur, huc illuc volvens oculos, totumque pererrat luminibus tacitis&rdquo; (362-364)</li>
<li>&ldquo;suscipiunt famulae conlapsaque membra marmoreo referunt thalamo stratisque reponunt&rdquo; (391-392)</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;All the time he had been speaking she was turned away from him, but looking at him, speechless and rolling her eyes, taking in every part of him&rdquo; &#x2013; action of turning away implies that she doesn&rsquo;t want to hear what he has to say, implying her fragility (adding to the sense of &rsquo;hysteria&rsquo; given the frenzy in a misogynistic context)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Her attendants caught her as she fainted&rdquo; &#x2013; fainting is a typical symbol of &rsquo;hysteria&rsquo; and &rsquo;womanly frenzy&rsquo;, but by making her sympathetic through Aeneas&rsquo; actions, Virgil brings into question the cruelty of what drove their relationship to this: the gods and the Fates</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="orga81e4d6">What does Dido say?</h2>
<ul style="text-align:left">
<li>&ldquo;perfide&rdquo; (305)</li>
<li>&ldquo;nec te noster amor &#x2026; tenet&rdquo; (307-308)</li>
<li>&ldquo;per conubia nostra, per inceptos hymenaeos&rdquo; (316)</li>
<li>&ldquo;te propter eundem exstinctus pudor et, qua sola sidera adibam, fama prior&rdquo; (321-323)</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;You traitor&rdquo; &#x2013; initial address to Aeneas, particularly charged and potent language emphasises not Aeneas&rsquo; evil but her own madness in the context of the descriptions of her frenzy</li>
<li>&ldquo;Does our love have no claim on you?&rdquo; &#x2013; somewhat ironic given that she is the one who has broken with all temper and is possessed by their love</li>

<li>A number of lines of self-pity and accusation intervene between &ldquo;I beg you&rdquo; and &ldquo;give up this plan of yours&rdquo; &#x2013; incoherent phraseology portrays her madness</li>

<li>&ldquo;I beg you by our union, by the marriage we have begun&rdquo; &#x2013; pathetic because they have not married, she lives in a world of wishful thinking shattered by the harsh reality of the situation, and thus becomes a sympathetic character, yet one who perhaps ultimately serves to highlight Aeneas&rsquo; piety</li>
<li>&ldquo;Because of you I have lost all conscience and self-respect and have thrown away the good name I once had, my only hope of reaching the stars&rdquo; &#x2013; extreme hyperbole</li>

</ul>

</aside>

<section>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;cui me moribundam deseris, hospes, hoc solum nomen quoniam de coniuge restat?&rdquo; (323-324)</li>
<li>&ldquo;ante fugam suboles, si quis mihi parvulus aula luderet Aeneas&rdquo; (328-329)</li>
<li>&ldquo;qui te tamen ore referret non equidem omnino capta ac deserta viderer&rdquo; (329-330)</li>
<li>&ldquo;perfide&rdquo; (366) (again as a response to Aeneas))</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Guest&rsquo; is the only name I can now give the man who used to be my husband&rdquo; &#x2013; pathetic hyperbole constructs her as further sympathetic, she feels betrayed</li>
<li>&ldquo;If only you had given me a child before you abandoned me!&rdquo; &#x2013; extension of marital idea, pathetic sense that her beliefs are founded on false hope</li>
<li>&ldquo;In spite of everything his face would remind me of yours and I would not feel utterly betrayed and desolate&rdquo; &#x2013; links back to her cradling Ascanius (which is now realised as proleptic irony given the beauty of that scenario)</li>
<li>&ldquo;You are a traitor&rdquo; (response to Aeneas) &#x2013; she is ruled by emotion, and ignores the practicalities of the scenario (thus a sympathetic character given Aeneas&rsquo; actions, but perpetuatues stereotype that men are needed to define women&rsquo;s emotions into logical sense, Aeneas is &rsquo;pulled down&rsquo; with Dido (both literally and metaphorically!))</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;nec tibi diva parens, generis nec Dardanus auctor, perfide, sed duris genuit te cautibus horrens Caucasus, Hyrcanaeque admorunt ubera tigres&rdquo; (365-367)</li>
<li>&ldquo;iam iam nec maxima Iuno nec Saturnius haec oculis pater aspicit aequis&rdquo; (371-372)</li>
<li>&ldquo;nusquam tuta fides&rdquo; (373)</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;You are not the son of a goddess and Dardanus was not the first founder of your family. It was the Caucasus that fathered you on its hard rocks and Hyrcanian tigers offered you their udders&rdquo; &#x2013; extreme hyperbole and denial of celestial origins, but allusion to goddess also reminds us of her charming, making this passage perhaps question more broadly the interference of the gods in human affairs (is Dido fated to this torment, or has she simply been led into it by Cupid and Venus?)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Can mighty Juno and the son of Saturn, the father of all, can they now look at this with the eyes of justice?&rdquo; &#x2013; questions justice of the action, but we know Aeneas is fated to leave her (and he has reiterated that to her as well), so fate comes to be the tragic motivator in this relationship (very similar to star-crossed lovers)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Is there nothing we can trust in this life?&rdquo; &#x2013; metaphysical questioning about the interference of the gods and fate in human affairs? (also links to Ariadne&rsquo;s cursing in Catullus 64, though more advanced if it is metaphysical in this way)</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;cur mea dicta negat duras demittere in auris?&rdquo; (428)</li>
<li>&ldquo;testor, cara, deos et te, germana, tuumque dulce caput, magicas invitam accingier artes&rdquo; (492-493)</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Why are his cruel ears closed to what I am saying?&rdquo; &#x2013; ironic, she&rsquo;s the one who refuses to hear what he&rsquo;s saying (yet another layer of celestial cruelty, she cannot react meaningfully (not the right word, but point stands))</li>
<li>[To Anna] &ldquo;I call the Gods and you own sweet self to witness, O my dearest sister, that it is not by my own will that I have recourse to magic arts&rdquo; &#x2013; clear echoing of Aeneas&rsquo; statements that he doesn&rsquo;t search for Italy by his own will, both characters are tragically deprived of agency, making us wonder what level of responsibility they have for al this, and to what extent the gods/fates are responsible as tragic instigators</li>

<h2 id="org21edb52">What does Dido think?</h2>
<ul style="text-align:left">
<li>&ldquo;inops animi totamque incensa&rdquo; (300)</li>
<li>&ldquo;sic accensa profatur&rdquo; (364)</li>
<li>Repetition of &ldquo;praeterea&rdquo; (e.g. 457)</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Driven to distraction and burning with passion&rdquo; &#x2013; frenzied with love, constructed as character subservient to her emotions and feelings for Aeneas</li>
<li>&ldquo;At last she replied on a blaze of passion&rdquo; &#x2013; contrast to Aeneas&rsquo; temperance, revokes some of our sympathy for her, but then she becomes a sympathetic figure once again by Aeneas&rsquo; care for her (perhaps a secondary critique of human allegiances and how they can disobey celestial and ordained will)</li>
<li>Repetition of &ldquo;there was more&rdquo; implies never-ending nature of Dido&rsquo;s suffering</li>

</ul>

</aside>

<section id="slide-org3fc6cce">
<h2 id="org3fc6cce">What does the narrator say about Dido?</h2>
<ul style="text-align:left">
<li>&ldquo;quis fallere possit amantem?&rdquo; (296)</li>
<li>&ldquo;omnia tuta timens&rdquo; (298)</li>
<li>&ldquo;aegra&rdquo; (389)</li>
<li>&ldquo;improbe Amor, quid non mortalia pectora cogis!&rdquo; (412))</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;But who can deceive a lover?&rdquo; &#x2013; description as a lover establishes her position as subservient to emotion (a theme that carries through this section in a mode that seems to convey a notably sexist sense of &rsquo;hysteria&rsquo;)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Afraid when there was nothing to fear&rdquo; &#x2013; further adds to that sense of constant anxt and dependence on Aeneas, again a subservience to her emotion</li>
<li>&ldquo;In utter despair&rdquo; &#x2013; she is sympathetic character</li>
<li>&ldquo;Love is a cruel master. There are no lengths to which it does not force the human heart&rdquo; &#x2013; doubly true, as Dido is mastered by love (and emotion? or just love?) and has thus become cruel to Aeneas (but whose cruelty started all this?); possibility of gender inversion, is love not a cruel <i>mistress</i>? (Venus!); also obvious broader psychological point</li>

</ul>

</aside>

</section>
<section>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;carmine bubo&rdquo; (462) juxtaposed with &ldquo;velleribus niveis&rdquo; (459)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Ergo ubi concepit furias evicta dolore decrevitque mori, tempus secum ipsa modumque exigit&rdquo; (474-476)</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Juxtaposition between &ldquo;song of death&rdquo;, black milk (paraphrased from 454), and the &ldquo;white fleeces&rdquo; contrasts her love for Aeneas with the reality of circumstance now (&ldquo;love is a cruel master&rdquo; once again)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Dido was overwhelmed by grief and possessed by madness. She decided to die and planned in her mind the time and the means&rdquo; &#x2013; explicit statement of the extent of her love-affliction, the game by Venus loses all sense of jollity, and the real impacts of the gods on human suffering are showcased here (link back to bloke who stole fire?)</li>

<h2 id="org738a063">What do other characters say about Dido?</h2>
<ul style="text-align:left">
<li>&ldquo;ego te, quae plurima fando enumerare vales, numquam, regina, negabo promeritam, nec me meminisse pigebit Elissae, dum memor ipse mei, dum spiritus hos regit artus&rdquo; (333-336)</li>
<li>&ldquo;nec coniugis umquam praetendi taedas aut haec in foedera veni&rdquo; (338-339)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Italiam non sponte sequor&rdquo; (361)</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;I shall never deny [the kindnesses you have given me] and never be sorry to remember Dido while I remember myself, while my spirit still governs this body&rdquo; &#x2013; again a sympathetic reaction by Aeneas to Dido&rsquo;s frenzy, making her sympathetic, but bringing her concerns to the forefront as legitimate (a partial departure from the previously more misogynistic construction we might expect); also the idea of a body being governed raises questions perhaps about what governs Dido (portrayed as overly emotional)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Nor have I ever offered you marriage or entered into that contract with you&rdquo; &#x2013; sympathetic undermining of much of what Dido has said, exposing the false hope that underlies much of her frenzy (psychological question is raised that a doubt of the truth of that might be the cause of her anguish, and thus Virgil comments more deeply on the human psyche and the nature of anguish, again making Dido a sympathetic character and an exploration of human grief and anguish)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do not go on causing distress to yourself and to me by these complaints. It is not by my own will that I search for Italy&rdquo; &#x2013; appeal to Dido&rsquo;s rationality, but an ironic one, because Aeneas doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand the extent to which he has undermined Dido&rsquo;s sense of allegiance, he has robbed her of all formal love in their relationship by denying their marriage, thus leaving her with nothing (an exploration of how many men fail to understand emotion perhaps?)</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="org4ec78f7">How do other characters react to Dido?</h2>
<ul style="text-align:left">
<li>&ldquo;ille Iovis monitis immota tenebat lumina et obnixus curam sub corde premebat&rdquo; (331-332)</li>
<li>&ldquo;at pius Aeneas&rdquo; (393)</li>
<li>&ldquo;sed nullis ille movetur fletibus, aut voces ullas tractabilis audit; fata obstant, placidasque viri deus obstruit auris&rdquo; (438-439)</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Aeneas did not move his eyes and struggled to fight down the anguish in his heart&rdquo; &#x2013; Aeneas reacts sympathetically to Dido&rsquo;s plight, thus she becomes a further sympathetic character, yet there is certainly the sense of her serving to portray his piety (thus furthering Virgil&rsquo;s broader political praisings in <i>The Aeneid</i>)</li>
<li>&ldquo;But Aeneas was faithful to his duty&rdquo; &#x2013; he is pious, but longs to be able to love her (they are both pathetic, the tragedy is instigated celestially)</li>
<li>&ldquo;[Aeneas] heard but did not heed her words. The Fates forbade it and the Gods blocked his ears to all appeals&rdquo; &#x2013; undermines previous statement by Dido that Aeneas isn&rsquo;t hearing her, the tragic element is again the gods</li>
<li>&ldquo;[Aeneas] felt the pain in his mighty heart but his mind remained unmoved and the tears rolled in vain&rdquo; &#x2013; strong man against weak woman stereotype embodied here, but the tragic element is not him, it&rsquo;s the celestial motivation</li>
